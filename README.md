# BidMeApp
BidMeApp is a Flask-based WebApp developed for a consulting project, whose goal was to estimate the probability of success of online auction bids on retailer products.

The WebApp is currently hosted and publicly available on Heroku (https://bidmeapp.herokuapp.com). The Demo version of BidMeApp is free-access, while a full version - which unlocks a considerably larger database of products - is currently password protected.
Please visit https://bidmeapp.herokuapp.com to give it a try.

BidMeApp is powered by a machine learning model trained and validated on a set of products provided by the consulting company. The full training dataset and the model are not explicitly provided in this repository (only a pickled version of the model and a subset of products are loaded).
